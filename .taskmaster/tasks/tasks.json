Add proper error handling for refresh failures, implement token rotation logic, and ensure seamless user experience when tokens expire. Include validation of refresh token expiration and proper fallback to re-authentication when refresh tokens are invalid.\n<info added on 2025-10-13T11:27:34.163Z>\n**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**\n\nSuccessfully implemented complete OAuth token refresh functionality in src/lib/auth.ts (lines 120-193). Key achievements:\n\n- Created refreshAccessToken() function that properly calls Google OAuth2 token endpoint with refresh_token grant type\n- Implemented comprehensive error handling for all refresh failure scenarios including invalid_grant errors  \n- Added automatic session cleanup when refresh tokens become invalid or expired\n- Implemented token rotation logic that updates both access and refresh tokens when Google provides new refresh token\n- Enhanced getUserFromToken() with automatic token expiration detection and seamless refresh capability\n- Ensured zero-interruption user experience - users remain authenticated through token refresh process\n- Added proper validation for refresh token expiration timestamps\n- Implemented robust fallback mechanism that triggers re-authentication only when refresh tokens are completely invalid\n- Included proper error logging and cleanup throughout the refresh flow\n\nThe implementation is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, automatic cleanup processes, and maintains seamless user authentication experience. All TODO items in the authentication system have been resolved.\n</info added on 2025-10-13T11:27:34.163Z>",
