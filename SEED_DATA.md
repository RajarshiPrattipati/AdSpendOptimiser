## üöÄ How to Seed Data

### Method 1: Via API (Recommended - When App is Running)

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Make a POST request to the seed endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/seed \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
   ```

   Or use the browser/Postman with your authenticated session.

3. You'll receive a response with a summary of created data.

### Method 2: Via CLI (When Database is Accessible)

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

This runs the `prisma/seed.ts` script directly.

## üéØ Testing Features with Seed Data

- Test prediction, impact estimation, confidence scoring

### Duplicate Keyword Detection

### Negative Keyword Analysis
- 3 search terms flagged as negative candidates
- Use `/api/search-terms` endpoint

- Verify action prioritization

## üîÑ Re-seeding

The seed script automatically cleans up existing test data before creating new data. You can run it multiple times safely.

**Note:** Only data for the authenticated user is affected. Other users' data remains untouched.

## üìä Verification

After seeding, verify the data:

1. **Check Prisma Studio:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:studio
   ```

2. **Test API Endpoints:**
   - GET `/api/accounts` - Should show 2 accounts
   - GET `/api/campaigns` - Should show 3 campaigns
   - GET `/api/recommendations` - Should show 7 recommendations
   - GET `/api/keywords` - Should show 6 keywords
   - GET `/api/analysis` - Should work with campaign IDs

3. **Test Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to `/dashboard`
   - Select "Test Client Account - E-Commerce Store"
   - View campaigns, keywords, recommendations

## üé® Customization

To modify the seed data:

1. Edit `prisma/seed.ts` or `src/app/api/seed/route.ts`
2. Adjust campaign budgets, metrics, keywords as needed
3. Add more recommendations or campaigns
4. Re-run the seed script

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Database Connection Issues:**
- Ensure your `.env` file has correct `DATABASE_URL`
- Check if Supabase database is accessible
- Use the API method if CLI fails

**Duplicate Key Errors:**
- The script automatically cleans up old data
- If errors persist, manually delete test accounts in Prisma Studio

**Missing User:**
- Seed via API (requires authenticated user)
- Or manually create a user first, then run CLI seed

## üìù Notes

- All test data is clearly labeled (e.g., "Test Manager Account")
- Customer IDs are fictional: 1234567890, 9876543210
- Access tokens are placeholders: "test-access-token"
- Metrics use realistic values but are randomized
- Recommendations have future `validUntil` dates (30 days from creation)
