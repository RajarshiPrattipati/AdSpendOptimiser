HOW TO FIND DATABASE CONNECTION STRING IN SUPABASE
===================================================

EXACT STEPS:
============

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/otleprdqubsrygwedqsa

2. In the LEFT SIDEBAR, look for a GEAR/COG icon ‚öôÔ∏è
   - It should say "Project Settings" when you hover over it
   - Click on it

3. In the Settings menu, click "Database"
   (Should be in the left menu under Project Settings)

4. Scroll down on that page - you'll see sections:
   - General
   - Connection Info
   - Connection string
   - Connection pooling  ‚Üê THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED

5. Under "Connection pooling" section:
   - There's a dropdown for "Mode" (select "Transaction" or "Session")
   - Below that, you'll see a connection string like:
     postgresql://postgres.[something]:[password]@....pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres

   - There's usually an eye icon üëÅÔ∏è to reveal the password
   - Copy the entire string

IF YOU DON'T SEE "CONNECTION POOLING" SECTION:
==============================================

Your Supabase project might be on an older version or free tier without pooling.

In that case, look for "Connection string" section instead:
- You'll see different options: URI, PSQL, etc.
- Look for one that mentions "pooler" or port "6543"

ALTERNATIVE - CHECK IF PROJECT IS OLD/FREE TIER:
================================================

If you don't have connection pooling at all:

1. Check your Supabase plan (Settings ‚Üí Subscription)
2. If on old free tier, you might need to use direct connection only

3. For now, use the DIRECT connection in Netlify:
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:btZnCjHCDqRfUNFF@db.otleprdqubsrygwedqsa.supabase.co:5432/postgres

4. This will work but isn't optimal for serverless

SCREENSHOT WHERE YOU ARE:
========================

If you're still stuck:
1. Take a screenshot of what you see in Settings ‚Üí Database
2. Share it (blur any passwords/secrets)
3. I'll tell you exactly where to look
